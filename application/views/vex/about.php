<p>Six Sided Simulations is pleased to introduce VEX, the first collectible card game (or CCG) for one or more players with a theme of flags. VEX (from the word Vexillology, the study of flags) is actually a set of games using the same full color flag cards as a base. Each card of VEX contains over a dozen pieces of information about the flag of a single political entity. In the first set, VEX I, the cards are boxed in decks of 60 flags taken randomly from a population of 200 nations of the world. VEX II expands the population with 200 new images of states and provinces, also packaged 60 random cards per box. VEX III adds even more cards with 200 new images of historical flags from around the world. VEX IV returns to the subnationals, with 200 new images of cantons and prefectures, also packaged 60 per box. The latest edition VEX V adds even more cards with 200 new images of international flags from around the world.</p>
<p>Unlike many other CCGs, there are no booster packs, rarities or uncommon cards. In fact, in each VEX edition there are 200 flags in the total population, packaged 60 cards per box, with an identical distribution. In addition, there are no duplicates in any box! For example, to get a complete set of all 200 cards from countries of the world would require purchasing a minimum of four VEX I, and might involve some trading as well. A checklist of all available cards for each edition is included in each box, and both the checklists and card contests are available on the web site.</p>
<p>Included in each box of VEX are rules to over 5 games, with varying degrees of difficulty, each playable with a single deck. The simplest game involves matching colors on flags in a gin-like manner and is playable by school age children. The games included in VEX I are basic VEX , like Rummy; 18 Flags of Golf, an introduction to the card system whereby players match attributes of the "hole" card using "stroke" cards, and taking as few strokes as necessary; Flagship, a Battleship-like clone; 21-Flag Salute, like Blackjack; Capture the Flag, VEXâ€™s card game version of an outdoor game by the same name; and Flagstone, whereby players form sets of cards based upon criteria that are met with each flag. VEX II and III add five new games, and VEX IV and V add five more games, for a total of fifteen games, each playable with any single deck.</p>
<p>Retail price for 1-4 decks of 60 full color cards is $10 each, 5-9 decks $9 each and an attractive display case of 10 decks (600 cards) is $80.
